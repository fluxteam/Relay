# Open Source Libraries {: #title }

Relay was built with open source libraries. Without these libraries it wouldn't be possible to create Relay. A big thank you to all the open source libraries used in the development of Relay, and to the developers of the libraries, and all the people who contributed to these libraries! Here is a list of libraries (direct dependencies) that Relay uses, sorted alphabetically.
